It's a snake game I made with my bro as final project for programming fundamentals in first semeseter.

<p>To play the game simply choose a game mode (simple, endless and custom)</p>

<h1>Simple</h1>
<p>Simple game mode consists of levels with obstacles increasing with each other making the game more fun to play</p>

<h1>Endless</h1>
<p>Endless game mode has telepathic walls that let u move from one wall end to the other making the game more relaxing to play. Also there is a powerup as well, that resets the snake length back to 1.</p>

<h1>Custom</h1>
<p>Allows you to unleash your creativity by giving you the ability to design levels, adjust snake speed, toggling telepathic walls and increasing food amount.</p>
